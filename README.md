# TM4C123G Microcontroller Experiments and Examples

## Peripheral Bare-Metal Examples
* Each example has been created by studying the datasheet.
* No external libraries used in order to have full control over peripherals.

### ADC7-TM4C123G
Read analog input using ADC 7

### GPIOPF-TM4C123G
Control GPIO outputs on port F (Tiva C LEDs)

## Basic Board-Support Examples
Development of board support header file which contains board specific memory addresses and functions. Onboard LEDS and buttons used to implement a sequential background forground program.
