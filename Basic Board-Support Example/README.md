# Basic Sequential Program to Implment Board Support Header Files

## Motivation
* Basic example program to test bsp.h and bsp.c.
* Implementation of background foregound code.

## Issues and Limitaions
1. Button presses are not instantly recgonised.
2. Delay function blocks CPU.

## Future Improvements
1. CMSIS so individual addresses do not have to be entered into bsp.h
2. Use timers instead of delay function.
